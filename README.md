# Stock-Tracker

# This is my first python project that I created while learning python at school

# This application is used to track data of a stock of your choice using a CSV file through a GUI that I made allowing import of CSV file directly to the application itself

# The GUI is simple enough for anyone to use

# If there is anything that would made this application better please let me know :)
